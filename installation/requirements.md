# Requirements

Most of the modules used in `time-decode` are readily available in Python 3, however the modules `python-dateutil` and `colorama` are required, and not typically installed by default. When installing `time-decode` using either the [pip (PyPI)](using-pip-pypi.md) method or the [pip (GitHub)](using-pip-github.md) method, these are installed during installation.

When installing via the [Manual Installation](manual-installation.md) method, these will need to be installed before first use.
