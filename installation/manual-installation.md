# Manual Installation

While the setup options using pip to install either from [PyPI](using-pip-pypi.md) or from [GitHub](using-pip-github.md) will install time-decode in its necessary location, you may choose to simply download the script and execute it separately.

To do so, you can simply go to: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalsleuth/time\_decode/master/time\_decode/time\_decode.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalsleuth/time\_decode/master/time\_decode/time\_decode.py) and save the script wherever you wish, and mark it as executable.
